# Project Executor Design v1

## Status

Design document only.

This document does not implement Project Executor and does not change runtime, core, bridge, executor, tools, permissions, approvals, or operational configuration.

## Evidence Base

This design is based on recent real Project Executor-style documentation work:

- `references/neodaemon_operating_model_v2.md`
- `references/openclaw_role_model_v1.md`
- PR #108: Skill documentation audit and alignment across multiple files.
- PR #109: executive project state audit and task_manager update.
- `task_manager/projects/neodaemon.json`

## What Worked In Recent Tests

PR #108 showed that NeoDaemon can complete a coherent multi-file documentation audit inside the Skill perimeter:

- audit existing documents;
- identify objective inconsistencies;
- patch multiple related files;
- validate through the controlled publication route;
- create a PR;
- leave merge and cleanup to Albert.

PR #109 showed that NeoDaemon can update executive state across `task_manager` and Skill references:

- read current state;
- identify obsolete priorities;
- update compact project state;
- update supporting references;
- create a PR with an executive report.

These tests support the Project Executor principle:

```text
objective → execution → validation → PR → Albert decision
```

without intermediate proposal chains for obvious substeps.

## Remaining Friction

Current execution still depends on compatibility routes:

- folder/path-specific publication behavior;
- staged-file edge cases for new directories;
- limited read-only runtime inspection;
- manual route selection by NeoDaemon;
- inability to treat `docs/**` as a fully active documentation perimeter yet;
- no single executor command owns preflight, edit, validation, commit, PR, and report.

The friction is not mainly strategic. It is architectural: there is no single Project Executor component yet.

## What Is Project Executor?

Project Executor is the future NeoDaemon execution mode where an approved objective grants permission for normal project-local execution inside a defined perimeter.

The unit of work is:

```text
the project
```

not:

```text
the command
the file
the folder-specific allowlist
```

Project Executor should turn Albert's objective into:

```text
scoped work → validated diff → PR → evidence report
```

## Problem It Solves

Project Executor solves the Assistant-Controlled Model failure mode:

```text
objective → proposal → proposal for substep → proposal for unblock → execution
```

It replaces that with:

```text
objective → execution → validation → PR → Albert decision
```

It reduces unnecessary human interactions while preserving Protected Zones, PR review, manual merge, and manual cleanup.

## Operating Flow

1. Albert defines an objective.
2. NeoDaemon checks that the objective is inside the approved perimeter.
3. NeoDaemon creates or reuses a safe branch.
4. NeoDaemon audits relevant files.
5. NeoDaemon applies project-local changes.
6. NeoDaemon validates by file type and policy.
7. NeoDaemon creates a PR with a report.
8. Albert reviews and decides merge or no merge.
9. NeoDaemon cleans up only after exact cleanup confirmation.

## Operating Perimeter

Initial real perimeter:

```text
OpenClaw-NeoDaemon-Skill/**
task_manager/**
docs/**/*.md
```

The current evidence strongly supports Skill and task_manager work. `docs/**/*.md` is documented as the desired documentation perimeter, but it still requires implementation before it is fully active.

Out of perimeter by default:

```text
runtime
core
bridge
executor
tools
service configuration
gateway/routing/model areas
host-wide shell
external actions
sensitive material
```

## Protected Zones

Protected Zones are hard boundaries. If a project requires touching one, Project Executor must block and ask Albert for an explicit exception.

Protected Zones include:

- runtime files;
- OpenClaw core;
- bridge/executor/tools;
- service configuration;
- gateway/routing/model areas;
- external communication surfaces;
- private or sensitive material;
- destructive Git operations.

Protected Zones are not soft warnings. They are stop conditions.

## Mandatory Validations

Project Executor must validate:

- branch is not `main`;
- repo starts clean or pre-existing dirty state is explicitly reported;
- changed files stay inside the approved perimeter;
- Protected Zone scanner passes;
- changed Markdown exists and is non-empty;
- changed JSON parses when JSON is in the perimeter;
- changed shell/Python files validate only if those file types are explicitly inside the perimeter;
- staged diff has no sensitive material;
- PR body reports scope, files, validations, blockers, and rollback;
- no merge was performed;
- no cleanup was performed automatically.

## Required Components

### 1. Project Policy

Machine-readable definition of:

- allowed roots;
- blocked roots;
- allowed file types;
- validation rules;
- max files or diff budget;
- PR/report requirements.

### 2. Project Executor Command

One controlled entrypoint responsible for:

```text
preflight → branch → edit support → validation → commit → push → PR → report
```

### 3. Protected Zone Scanner

A hard blocker that runs before commit and before push.

Initial standalone component:

```text
scripts/project/protected_zone_scanner_v1.py
```

This scanner evaluates repository-relative paths, normalizes `./` prefixes, blocks absolute paths and parent traversal, allows the initial Project Executor perimeter, and returns JSON with `status`, `safe`, `files_evaluated`, and `blocked` entries.

It is not integrated automatically yet.

### 3.1 NeoDaemon Healthcheck

Initial standalone component:

```text
scripts/project/neodaemon_healthcheck_v1.py
```

This healthcheck is offline-only and read-only. It gives an SSH-friendly local signal for whether NeoDaemon can perform project execution from the current repository state.

V1 checks only local evidence:

- Git is available;
- current directory is inside the repository;
- `git status --short` can run;
- worktree is clean;
- current branch is `main`;
- required local tool files are present;
- required project scripts are present.

It does not perform network, provider, gateway, model, runtime, or service checks in V1.

It is intended to be executed through:

```text
run_project_script_readonly
```

and returns JSON with `status`, `health_scope`, `local_can_work_now`, `bottlenecks`, `evidence`, `no_verificado`, `recommended_next_action`, and `checks`.

For fast human SSH interpretation, the same script also supports:

```text
--human
```

Human mode uses the same internal health result as JSON mode and prints a compact summary with status, local work capability, scope, branch, worktree state, critical tools, critical project scripts, recommended next action, and the V1 note that external connectivity is omitted.

### 3.2 Project Executor Preflight

Initial standalone component:

```text
scripts/project/project_executor_preflight_v1.py
```

This preflight is offline-only and read-only. It gives a reusable readiness gate before starting a Project Executor feature.

V1 checks local evidence only: repository validity, `git status --short`, current branch, required tool files, required project scripts, and healthcheck JSON availability.

It returns JSON with `status` (`READY`, `DEGRADED`, or `BLOCKED`), `can_start_feature`, `checks`, `blockers`, `warnings`, `evidence`, and `recommended_next_action`.

### 3.3 OpenClaw Status Signal Summary

Initial standalone component:

```text
scripts/project/openclaw_status_signal_summary_v1.py
```

This parser is read-only and does not execute OpenClaw. It converts text captured from the controlled native status inspection route into a compact operational signal.

V1 uses only `openclaw status` text. It does not use `openclaw status --usage`.

It returns JSON with `status` (`OK`, `WARNING`, `DEGRADED`, or `NO_VERIFICADO`), `signals`, `warnings`, `checks`, and `recommended_next_action`. Human mode is available with `--human`.

### 3.4 NeoDaemon Operational Status

Initial standalone component:

```text
scripts/project/neodaemon_operational_status_v1.py
```

This aggregator is read-only and does not execute OpenClaw, providers, or other project scripts. It combines already captured JSON signals into one short operational view.

V1 always separates local project work from heavy model work. Local work can be allowed while heavy model work remains warning or blocked.

It returns JSON with `status`, `can_work_now`, `risk_level`, `local_work`, `heavy_model_work`, `signals`, `blockers`, `warnings`, and `recommended_next_action`. Human mode is available with `--human`.

### 4. Validation Router

Chooses validations by file type and perimeter.

### 5. Execution Report Builder

Generates a consistent PR body and final response:

- result;
- branch;
- commit;
- PR URL;
- files touched;
- validations;
- blockers / NO_VERIFICADO;
- next action.

### 6. State Integrator

Optionally updates `task_manager/projects/neodaemon.json` after meaningful project state changes.

## Components That Could Disappear Or Become Compatibility Only

- folder-specific documentation publication routes;
- per-file publication expansion work;
- approval-driven command execution for normal project-local work;
- manual parking workflows caused by publication constraints;
- proposal chains for obvious project-local substeps;
- separate doc/data publication logic once Project Policy owns perimeter validation.

## Human Control Model

Human control remains:

- Albert defines objectives;
- GPT provides strategic supervision when needed;
- NeoDaemon executes inside perimeter;
- PR review is the main control point;
- merge is manual;
- cleanup is manual and hash-confirmed;
- Protected Zone exceptions go to Albert.

## Success Metrics

Measure Project Executor by:

- number of human interactions between objective and PR;
- percentage of project-local tasks completed without intermediate proposal chains;
- validation pass/fail clarity;
- PR reviewability;
- Protected Zone block accuracy;
- cleanup success after merge;
- reduction in path-specific publication changes;
- task_manager freshness after significant work.

Primary success metric from Role Model v1:

```text
Reduce the number of human interactions required between objective → PR while maintaining safety boundaries.
```

## Risks

Project Executor introduces real risks:

- broad objectives may create too-large PRs;
- perimeter mistakes may allow unsafe files;
- validation gaps may produce false confidence;
- Project Executor could duplicate legacy routes;
- automatic state updates could become noisy;
- runtime state may still be unknown without safe read-only inspection;
- GPT/NeoDaemon role boundaries may blur if strategy and execution mix.

## Risk Controls

Required controls:

- smallest coherent project scope;
- file/diff budget;
- Protected Zone scanner;
- validation router;
- PR-only delivery;
- manual merge;
- manual cleanup;
- explicit `NO_VERIFICADO` reporting;
- GPT strategic review for architecture drift or major design questions.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Documentation Perimeter Executor

Enable real Project Executor behavior for:

```text
OpenClaw-NeoDaemon-Skill/**
task_manager/**
docs/**/*.md
```

Goal: replace folder-specific documentation publication routes with one project policy.

### Phase 2: Validation Router

Add automatic validation by file type and policy.

Goal: make validation consistent instead of manually selected per task.

### Phase 3: Execution Report Builder

Standardize PR bodies and final responses.

Goal: Albert can review without asking for missing context.

### Phase 4: State Integration

Update `task_manager` only when state changes are meaningful.

Goal: keep executive state current without noise.

### Phase 5: Controlled Project-Local Expansion

Consider adding project-local tests or scripts only if there is evidence of need.

Goal: expand capability without weakening Protected Zones.

## Ready For Real Use Criteria

Project Executor is ready for real use when it can:

- complete a multi-file documentation/state project from objective to PR;
- require no intermediate proposal for obvious substeps;
- block a Protected Zone test case;
- validate changed files consistently;
- generate a complete PR report;
- leave `main` untouched;
- avoid merge and cleanup automation;
- preserve manual cleanup with exact hash;
- update task_manager only when useful.

## Non-Goals

This design does not implement Project Executor.

It does not change runtime, core, bridge, executor, tools, permissions, approvals, service configuration, or gateway behavior.
