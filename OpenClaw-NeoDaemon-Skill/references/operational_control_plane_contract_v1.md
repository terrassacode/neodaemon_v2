# Operational Control Plane Contract v1

## Status

Contract only. No runtime, gateway, model, scheduler, alert, Telegram, Gmail, UI, or dashboard changes.

## Purpose

Operational Control Plane V1 defines a single read-only source of truth for NeoDaemon/OpenClaw operational state.

It must answer:

- can NeoDaemon work locally now?
- can NeoDaemon start a Project Executor feature now?
- can NeoDaemon safely launch heavy model/Codex work now?
- what is the current operational risk?
- what is the next minimum action?

## Required Separation

V1 must always separate:

```text
can_work.local
can_work.start_feature
can_work.heavy_model
```

A local operation may be allowed while heavy model work is warning or blocked.

## Confidence Model

### HIGH

A HIGH-confidence signal is:

- local and direct;
- deterministic;
- functionally validated;
- low risk for misleading interpretation.

HIGH signals may allow or block local/start-feature decisions.

### MEDIUM

A MEDIUM-confidence signal is:

- useful but partial;
- possibly stale;
- possibly dependent on external output format;
- not proof of end-to-end availability.

MEDIUM signals may raise risk. They may block only when they report an explicit blocking state.

### LOW

A LOW-confidence signal is:

- mathematically valid but operationally ambiguous;
- useful for context and trend interpretation;
- not reliable as a blocking source by itself in V1.

LOW signals must remain visible as warnings/context but must not block by themselves.

## Initial Signal Confidence

```json
{
  "healthcheck": "HIGH",
  "preflight": "HIGH",
  "codex": "MEDIUM",
  "openclaw_status": "MEDIUM",
  "usage_dashboard": "LOW"
}
```

## Source Responsibilities

### healthcheck

Primary source for:

```text
can_work.local
```

Expected signal:

```text
neodaemon_healthcheck_v1.py
```

### preflight

Primary source for:

```text
can_work.start_feature
```

Expected signal:

```text
project_executor_preflight_v1.py
```

### codex

Primary source for:

```text
can_work.heavy_model
```

Expected signal:

```text
codex_status_readonly_v1.py
```

Rules:

- `PLAN_LIMIT_REACHED` blocks heavy model work.
- `SIGNIN_ERROR` blocks heavy model work.
- `RATE_LIMIT_OR_COOLDOWN` blocks heavy model work until state clears.
- `UNKNOWN` does not block local work, but raises heavy-model risk.

### openclaw_status

Source for:

- context pressure;
- gateway signal;
- task pressure;
- model/session context.

Expected signal:

```text
openclaw_status_signal_summary_v1.py
```

### usage_dashboard

Source for:

- activity trend;
- last 24h usage;
- previous 24h usage;
- comparison stability.

Rules:

- usage dashboard is LOW confidence in V1.
- it must not block by itself.
- it may add warnings such as low comparison base or unusual activity deltas.

## Required Phase Order

```text
Fase 0 — Contract
Fase 1 — Validation Fixtures
Fase 2 — Aggregator
Fase 3 — Human Summary
Fase 4 — Consumers
```

Reason:

Fixtures must exist before the aggregator so defective or misleading signals are not consolidated prematurely.

Initial fixtures live in:

```text
OpenClaw-NeoDaemon-Skill/references/operational_control_plane_fixtures_v1.md
```

They are data-only acceptance cases for the future aggregator and do not implement operational logic.

The fixtures-only aggregator lives in:

```text
scripts/project/operational_control_plane_aggregator_v1.py
```

It validates fixture expectations before any live signals are consumed.

Human summary mode is available with:

```text
--human
```

The human summary is derived from the same fixtures-only validation payload and must not recalculate or reinterpret source rules.

The first real-signal adapter lives in:

```text
scripts/project/operational_control_plane_real_signals_v1.py
```

V1 connects project healthcheck, project preflight, usage dashboard, and controlled OpenClaw status signals. Heavy model remains explicitly not connected.

Project healthcheck controls only `can_work.local`; project preflight remains the only source for `can_work.start_feature`.

Controlled OpenClaw status is read only through `inspect_openclaw_native_status_readonly` with `command=status`, then summarized by `scripts/project/openclaw_status_signal_summary_v1.py`. It must not modify `can_work.local`, `can_work.start_feature`, or `can_work.heavy_model`.

The real-signal adapter also supports `--human`, which renders a human summary derived from the same JSON payload. JSON remains the default output.

The real-signal adapter may include advisory `staleness` and `recommended_mode` fields. They must not change `can_work.local`, `can_work.start_feature`, `can_work.heavy_model`, `status`, or `risk_level`.

The real-signal adapter may include `health_ia` as an advisory LOW-confidence usage-health block derived from the existing usage dashboard source. It contains data, status, risk, details, and source metadata only. It must not store human interpretation text, must not change `can_work.*`, and must not change global `status` or `risk_level` by itself. If the source is missing or invalid, `health_ia.status` degrades to `NO_VERIFICADO` with `source.available=false`.

`recommended_mode` is advisory only. While `HEAVY_MODEL_NOT_CONNECTED_V1` is present, the recommended mode is `avoid_heavy_model`.

The snapshot file `dashboard-v2/data/operational_control_plane_v1.json` is a generated mutable artifact. It is generated on demand by `scripts/project/write_operational_control_plane_snapshot_v1.py`, is not source code, must not enter PRs, and may be deleted and regenerated.

## Acceptance Criteria For This Contract

- schema version is explicit;
- confidence model is defined;
- source responsibilities are defined;
- `can_work.local`, `can_work.start_feature`, and `can_work.heavy_model` are separate;
- usage dashboard is LOW confidence;
- consumers are explicitly out of scope;
- no runtime, gateway, model, scheduler, alert, Telegram, Gmail, UI, or dashboard change is introduced.

## Out Of Scope For V1 Contract

- implementation of the aggregator;
- visual dashboard;
- Telegram feedback;
- alerts;
- scheduler;
- runtime integration;
- model fallback;
- automatic corrective actions.
